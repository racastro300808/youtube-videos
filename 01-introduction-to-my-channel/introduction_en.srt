00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi, I`m a developer

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
and I think the world needs

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
more developers

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,800
especially well qualified

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
developers, and if you

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
are looking my channel, or ...

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
watching my videos you are clearly

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
one of those kind of people

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
that want to be

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
better persons,

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
better developers,

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
more qualified, skilful professionals.

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
And I`m just like you.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I want to change all the time

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I want to learn new

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
stuff all the time

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
and I think it`s

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
all about sharing

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I mean.. ahh

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
most of the things I have learned

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
I did on internet.

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
It`s no one personally told me

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
I read some documentation,

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
I watched videos

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
.. those kinds of materials

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
and so... I`m wiling

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
to share what I learned

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
during this time of

29
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,180
my professional carrier

30
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,180
and I`m willing to

31
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,180
... share it with you

32
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,180
wherever

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,180
are watching this videos

34
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,180
on Youtube.

35
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
Even because things I did on the past

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,180
I don't remember

37
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,180
anymore, and I have to

38
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,180
check out my own materials

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,180
and then I remember... "ahh

40
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,180
this detail you do this way...

41
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,180
that way..." and so on

42
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,180
.. and I

43
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,180
think videos is a really good

44
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
way to do It, because

45
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,180
you can keep a

46
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,180
dialogue

47
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,180
you can receive feedback , you can comment

48
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,180
and so on... and

49
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,180
I think is a really good way to share

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,180
what we learned.

51
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,180
I have plans to

52
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,180
start series about

53
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
Cake PHP,

54
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
and also CodeIgniter

55
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
and I`m staring to learn

56
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
a little bit better

57
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,180
about Zend Framework

58
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
and Symfony, and I

59
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
didn`t used yet

60
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
Laravel, but I plan to

61
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,180
learn, and as I`m learning

62
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,180
I plan to share something.

63
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180
But Cake and

64
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
Codeigniter

65
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,180
I have a great experience with that

66
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,180
I think I can share with you

67
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,180
a little bit. Ok?

68
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,180
Also Java... I have been working

69
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,180
with Java for sometime now

70
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,180
and Java is a

71
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,180
...

72
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,180
is a whole...

73
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,180
a whole new world

74
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,180
(complicated phrase   hum?)

75
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,180
.. because you can

76
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,180
develop anything

77
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,180
you can do Desktop applications

78
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
you can

79
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,180
do websites, you can do

80
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,180
client and server

81
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,180
applications like when you are using

82
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Jboss or something like

83
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,180
I mean, Java is

84
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,180
it`s a big world

85
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
to study

86
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,180
and you can do so much

87
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
stuff with Java, and

88
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
also Android. I did a course

89
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
on Android, and I can develop

90
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,180
some App`s and ahh

91
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,180
It`s not that difficult

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
you use a lot of Java

93
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
I mean, if you know Java

94
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
it`s not difficult

95
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,180
to do Android

96
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,180
applications

97
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
also because the IDE is really good

98
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
and sure... this channel

99
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
will always be open

100
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,180
to new stuff.

101
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,180
One of the new stuffs

102
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,180
that I`m starting

103
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,180
right now, is a English

104
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,180
version of my videos

105
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,180
I mean, I`m (also) a

106
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,180
language learner.

107
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,180
I`m from Brazil, so my native

108
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,180
language, my mother toggle

109
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
it`s Portuguese.

110
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
But I know some English and

111
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,180
also I know some German.

112
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,180
I mean, I want to

113
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
be professional on those languages.

114
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,180
At least English and German.

115
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
But also want to

116
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,180
achieve some good

117
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,180
...

118
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,180
skill level

119
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,180
of Spanish and French.

120
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180
On this way

121
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,180
I will be doing

122
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,180
this series on English

123
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,180
and I will be translating it

124
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,180
to Portuguese

125
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,180
and in German

126
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,180
and Spanish.

127
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180
For start. Maybe in the future

128
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,180
I will do it to French

129
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
as well. I mean, I don`t

130
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,180
know French yet, I`m just

131
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,180
a beginner. This way

132
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,180
I think this channel

133
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,180
will be a nice place to

134
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,180
experiment some new

135
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,180
stuff. Ok?

136
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,180
I hope you can enjoy it

137
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,180
you can..

138
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,180
give feedback, you can

139
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
fix things, you can give suggestions

140
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,180
whatever ok?

141
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,180
I`m really thankful

142
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180

143
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,180

147
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,180
criticism.

148
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
About things I did

149
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,180
not that well, I didn`t

150
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,180
implemented that well

151
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,180
It`s perfect! that is

152
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,180
the way

153
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,180
we can improve!

154
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Discussing things.

155
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Does not exists

156
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,180
this thing

157
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,180
"one approach be the right one"

158
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
... it is just approaches.

159
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,180
Just code...

160
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,180
you can write it in whatever in

161
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,180
various ways

162
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,180
It`s not

163
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,180
one definite

164
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,180
answer.

165
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,180
So I hope you enjoy

166
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,180
